# OverTheWire: Bandit

This folder documents my experience working through the Bandit wargame, a practical way to build confidence with the Linux command line. Each level introduces a new concept, from exploring directories to handling permissions and connecting over the network.

Bandit is part of my DevOps learning journey. It helps me strengthen my understanding of Linux by solving real challenges instead of just reading about them.
